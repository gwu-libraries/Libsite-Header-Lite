Libsite-Header-Lite
===================

Simple HTML minimal/lite header and footer. Includes both a static html version and a Twitter Bootswatch version.

Intended for use with GW Library tools like FindIt, Launchpad and SRRS and also vendor tools like Libguides that let you drop basic skinning via the admin UI.

The Bootstrap bootswatch includes Font Awesome! http://fontawesome.io/get-started

Implementation
--------------

The code is heavily commented. Start by looking at the html framework for your intended version:

Bootswatch html: bootswatch.html (example: http://gwdroid.wrlc.org/~aldridge/libheader/bootswatch.html)

Static html: page.html (example: http://gwdroid.wrlc.org/~aldridge/libheader/page.html)
